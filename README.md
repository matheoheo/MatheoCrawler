# Matheo Crawler
Matheo Crawler, is a 2D dungeon game, written used C++20 and SFML 3.0;
The project, is developed as part of portfolio, but might serve as a source of entertainment or inspiration for others.

# Features
I have developed a few different algorithms and techniques to better my skills and enrich the gameplay, such as:
  - Map generated procedurally using BSP
  - Pathfinding with A* algorithm
  - Recursive shadowcasting for visibility
  - Handling different states like Menu/Game State/Options, etc.. with State Pattern
  - Composite Pattern ("cheap ECS") used for architecture
  - Basic AI for monsters
  - Spell System
  - Upgradeable attributes and attack types.

Since the map is generated by code, i aimed to make the gameplay as long as user would like to play. That means, the player can upgrade his:
  - attributes (5 different)
  - blade arts (3 different types of attack)
  - spells (12 different spells in 3 types of categories).

//ToDo build requirments, cmake list, licenses, AI information, and more!
